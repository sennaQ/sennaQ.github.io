The most nature thing to put here would be how to build this blog.

[Kenneth's blog](https:www.kennethreitz.org) is a perfect example for me. So I decided to make a mock of that themem.a

I used to be focus on the details too fast when starting a project. I will keep try to keep on the main trunk this time.
Which is to have a side-bar on the left and always show contents on the right canvas.

That's sound simple but considering this is the very first blog I build from ground. I shouldn't expect it's an easy job.a

Better tools can boost the progress, and I choose Jekyll, Liquid, github page.

CSS and javascript, these two tells how contents are rendered and interacted with reader. I'm going to figure out how can I
get these two things done now


{% assign my_string = page.title %}
