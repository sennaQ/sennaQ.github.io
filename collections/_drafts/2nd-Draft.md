Now the desktop version of this blog looks not bad.

There're still plenty room for improvement, while I can only focus on the most important ones.

1. Mobile version
2. Image Gallery support
3. Clean up the codes, especially css part
4. social media icons, accounts
5. contents

Hopefully I could finish the first 4 tasks in two weeks,
and meanwhile thinking about the contents.
