title: This One Is Really Ugly

"It's just another kind of coronavirus."

I'm still confused by seeing the above opinion. It tells an obvious truth but sounds suspectful. Now I know that most of the flu are caused by coronavirus and most of ppl ignore the risk of flu all the time.

This one is really ugly.

I've told my parent to be prepared for living isolately for at least 1 month in case the same thing happening in Wuhan happens in their towns. Even though I'm afraid that 1 month is probably too short but it's almost impossible to ask them to prepare for longer time.

People who used to live in cities are such a vulnerable group when the city not functioning well. I don't know what I expected. Humankind is vulnerable at the fundamental and the achievement of Industrial revolution protect us so well.

I'd rather to be treated as a fool than under estimate the effects of this incident.

While life continues, love does as well.

Enjoy the weekend.
